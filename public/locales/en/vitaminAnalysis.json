        "vitaminA": {
          "low": "Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness, dry eyes, and increased susceptibility to infections. It may also cause skin issues and impaired immune function. Common in malnourished individuals or those with fat malabsorption disorders.",
          "high": "Excessive vitamin A can cause liver damage, bone pain, vision changes, and even hair loss. Chronic overconsumption may lead to increased intracranial pressure. Pregnant women should be especially careful as it can cause birth defects."
        },
        "vitaminB12": {
          "low": "B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, fatigue, nerve damage, and cognitive issues. Common in vegans, elderly, and those with pernicious anemia or gut absorption problems. Long-term deficiency can lead to irreversible neurological damage.",
          "high": "While rare, extremely high B12 levels may indicate liver disease, certain cancers, or kidney issues. It can sometimes occur with excessive supplementation. High levels don't necessarily mean toxicity but warrant investigation."
        },
        "vitaminC": {
          "low": "Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, causing bleeding gums, bruising, poor wound healing, and joint pain. Smokers, alcoholics, and those with poor diets are at higher risk. Essential for collagen production and immune function.",
          "high": "Excess vitamin C may cause diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps. In predisposed individuals, it can increase oxalate production leading to kidney stones. Generally excreted in urine but megadoses should be avoided."
        },
        "vitaminD": {
          "low": "Vitamin D deficiency causes bone softening (osteomalacia), muscle weakness, and increased infection risk. Common in northern climates, darker-skinned individuals, and those with limited sun exposure. Linked to depression and autoimmune diseases.",
          "high": "Vitamin D toxicity leads to hypercalcemia causing nausea, weakness, kidney stones, and even kidney failure. Usually from excessive supplementation rather than diet or sun exposure. Can cause calcium deposits in soft tissues."
        },
        "vitaminE": {
          "low": "Vitamin E deficiency may cause nerve damage (ataxia), muscle weakness, and vision problems. Rare but seen in fat malabsorption disorders like cystic fibrosis or Crohn's disease. Important antioxidant for cell protection.",
          "high": "Excess vitamin E can interfere with blood clotting, increasing bleeding risk especially in those on blood thinners. May also cause nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. Supplementation beyond recommended doses is generally unnecessary."
        },
        "vitaminK": {
          "low": "Vitamin K deficiency impairs blood clotting, leading to easy bruising and bleeding. Newborns are at risk (given prophylactic vitamin K). Seen in liver disease, malabsorption, or long-term antibiotic use.",
          "high": "While rare, excessive vitamin K (mainly from supplements) may interfere with blood thinners like warfarin. Natural food sources are generally safe. Important for maintaining proper coagulation balance."

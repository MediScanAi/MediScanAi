      "explanations": {
        "lowHemoglobin": "Anemia is a condition where the blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. It leads to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and pale skin. The most common causes include iron deficiency (due to poor diet or chronic bleeding), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and chronic diseases like kidney problems. In women, heavy menstruation is a frequent cause. In some cases, anemia may stem from bone marrow disorders or autoimmune conditions.",
        "highHemoglobin": "High hemoglobin can result from living at high altitudes, smoking, or conditions like polycythemia vera. Polycythemia refers to an elevated concentration of red blood cells, often leading to thickened blood and increased risk of clots. This can occur in response to low oxygen (from smoking or living at high altitudes), heart or lung diseases, or a rare condition called polycythemia vera, where the bone marrow produces too many blood cells. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, or a ruddy complexion.",
        "lowWbc": "Low white blood cell count can be caused by viral infections or bone marrow issues. A low white blood cell (WBC) count weakens the body's immune defense. It can be caused by viral infections, autoimmune diseases (like lupus), chemotherapy, certain medications, or bone marrow disorders. Patients with leukopenia are more susceptible to infections and may require close monitoring.",
        "highWbc": "A high white blood cell count often signals infection or inflammation. An elevated WBC count often signals an active infection or inflammation. It may also be linked to stress, trauma, or more serious conditions like leukemia. Temporary spikes in WBCs can occur during acute illness, but persistently high values warrant further investigation.",
        "lowRbc": "Red blood cells carry oxygen. Low RBCs can be caused by anemia, blood loss, or nutritional deficiencies. Anemia is a condition where the blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. It leads to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and pale skin. The most common causes include iron deficiency (due to poor diet or chronic bleeding), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and chronic diseases like kidney problems. In women, heavy menstruation is a frequent cause. In some cases, anemia may stem from bone marrow disorders or autoimmune conditions.",
        "highRbc": "High RBC count might suggest dehydration, lung or heart disease, or polycythemia vera. It can increase blood viscosity and risk of clotting. Polycythemia refers to an elevated concentration of red blood cells, often leading to thickened blood and increased risk of clots. This can occur in response to low oxygen (from smoking or living at high altitudes), heart or lung diseases, or a rare condition called polycythemia vera, where the bone marrow produces too many blood cells. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, or a ruddy complexion.",
        "lowPlatelets": "Low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia) may occur from immune disorders, liver issues, or medications. Platelets help with blood clotting. A low count can cause easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, or petechiae (tiny red spots on the skin). Common causes include liver disease, autoimmune disorders like ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), viral infections, or medication side effects.",
        "highPlatelets": "High platelet count might indicate inflammation, iron deficiency, or a bone marrow disorder. High platelet levels may be reactive (due to inflammation, infection, or surgery) or a sign of bone marrow disorders like essential thrombocythemia. Elevated platelets can increase the risk of blood clots or, paradoxically, bleeding complications.",
        "lowGlucose": "Low blood sugar can result in shakiness, confusion, or fainting. It's important to maintain a stable glucose level through diet and monitoring. It can be caused by diabetes, certain medications, or a lack of food intake. Symptoms may include sweating, rapid heartbeat, and confusion.",
        "highGlucose": "High glucose levels may signal diabetes or prediabetes. It's crucial to manage with lifestyle, diet, and possibly medication to avoid complications. Persistent high glucose levels suggest prediabetes or diabetes, especially if accompanied by symptoms like frequent urination, thirst, or unexplained weight loss. Long-term hyperglycemia can damage nerves, kidneys, and blood vessels.",
        "highCholesterol": "Excess cholesterol can build up in arteries, leading to heart attacks or strokes. Diet, exercise, and medication (like statins) can help control it. It can be caused by diabetes, certain medications, or a lack of food intake. Symptoms may include sweating, rapid heartbeat, and confusion."

                "brca1Positive": "A positive BRCA1 result indicates a mutation in this tumor suppressor gene, significantly increasing lifetime risk of breast (up to 72%), ovarian (up to 44%), and other cancers. BRCA1 helps repair DNA damage; mutations impair this function. Management includes enhanced screening (MRI/mammograms), risk-reducing medications, or preventive surgeries. Not all carriers develop cancer, but vigilance is crucial. Genetic counseling helps interpret results and guide family testing.",
                "brca2Positive": "BRCA2 mutations elevate risks for breast (up to 69%), ovarian (up to 17%), pancreatic, and other cancers. Like BRCA1, it's involved in DNA repair. Male carriers have increased breast and prostate cancer risks. Management parallels BRCA1, with consideration of pancreatic cancer screening for high-risk families. PARP inhibitors are particularly effective treatments for BRCA-related cancers.",
                "factorVLeidenPositive": "Factor V Leiden makes blood resistant to protein C, increasing clotting risk 5-10x (heterozygous) or 50-100x (homozygous). Most carriers never clot, but risks rise with surgery, pregnancy, or hormones. Symptoms include DVT or PE. Management focuses on clot prevention during high-risk situations. Lifelong anticoagulation isn't usually needed without clotting history.",
                "apoeE4E4": "Two Œµ4 alleles confer the highest Alzheimer's risk (up to 15x increased). The Œµ4 protein clears amyloid plaques less effectively. However, not all carriers develop dementia. Prevention focuses on heart-healthy lifestyle (exercise, Mediterranean diet, cognitive engagement). Testing is generally not recommended predictively due to limited clinical utility.",
                "mthfrHomozygous": "Homozygous C677T mutations reduce enzyme activity by ~70%, potentially elevating homocysteine. The clinical significance is debated, but may modestly increase cardiovascular and pregnancy risks. Management may include methylfolate (not folic acid) supplementation if homocysteine is elevated, though routine treatment isn't universally recommended.",
                "cyp2c19PoorMetabolizer": "Poor metabolizers process certain drugs very slowly, increasing side effects or requiring dose reductions. Affected medications include clopidogrel (reduced effectiveness), many antidepressants, and proton pump inhibitors. Pharmacogenetic testing can guide alternative drug selection (e.g., prasugrel instead of clopidogrel) or dosing adjustments."
